Netdisco is written in Perl and self-contained apart from the PostgreSQL
database, so is very easy to install and runs well on any linux or unix
system.

It includes a lightweight web server for the interface, a backend daemon to
gather data from your network, and a command line interface for
troubleshooting. There is a simple configuration file in YAML format.

Please check out the [installation
instructions](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::Netdisco) on CPAN.

You can also speak to someone in the
`[#netdisco@freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&prompt=1&channels=%23netdisco)`
IRC channel, or on the [community email
list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/netdisco-users).

Some of the things you can do with Netdisco:

* Locate a machine on the network by MAC or IP
* Turn off a switch port, or change the VLAN or PoE status of a port
* Inventory your network by model, vendor, and software
* Pretty pictures of your network
